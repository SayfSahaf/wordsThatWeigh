I built this quote-generating website to learn how to utilize APIs. This project also allowed me to practice and hone my HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  

The webpage has three buttons users can interact with:
1. Copy button - Uses the Clipboard API to copy the quote on display along with the author's name.
2. About button - Whenever the relevant data is available, the button changes its appearance and displays a brief biography about the author when clicked.
3. Next button - This button is attached to an event listener that, when clicked, fetches a new quote using the API and displays the appropriate information on the screen.

Working on this project was really fun and it made me realize just how powerful APIs can be. I hope to create more functional web apps in the future, utilizing a lot of APIs.
