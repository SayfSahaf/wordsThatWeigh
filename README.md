I built this quote-generating website to learn how to utilize APIs. This project also allowed me to practice and hone my HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
[Link to the website](https://sayfsahaf.github.io/wordsThatWeigh/).

The webpage has three buttons:
1. Copy button - Uses the Clipboard API to copy the quote on display along with the author's name.
2. About button - Whenever the relevant data is available, the button changes its appearance and displays a brief biography about the author when clicked.
3. Next button - This button is attached to an event listener that, when clicked, fetches a new quote using the API and displays the appropriate information on the screen.
